	<h3>A website about moths</h3>
	<img src="images/hcecropia.jpg" id="imgf" alt="moth"/>
	<p id="intro">Welcome, this website is dedicated to documenting the beautiful, striking, or factually interesting species of moths from all over the world. Although you may think of them as dull grey-colored nuisances, moths come in all shapes and colors and can be just as beautiful as their butterfly cousins.</p>
	<p>Speaking of butterflies, did you know that some moths look like butterflies and some butterflies look like moths? Both of them belong to the order Lepidoptera. The butterflies are a monophyletic group, meaning they all share a common ancestor, but the moths are not. This makes dividing the Lepidoptera into natural groups difficult.</p>
	<p>However, there are some obvious differences between moths and butterflies which you can use to tell the two apart. First of all, most moths are nocturnal and most butterflies are diurnal, so if you see one during the day, it's most likely a butterfly. Second, butterflies undergo metamorphosis in a chryslais while moths spin a silk cocoon. Most butterflies have antennae that look like little clubs, they are wider at the tips. Moth antennae often have tiny bristles and they are not club-shaped. Butterflies are famous for the beautiful patterns of their wings. The most common moths have faded earthly tones and dull camouflage patterns. Moths have stout hairy bodies, butterflies are more slender. Butterflies typically hold their wings above their back wehen resting, moths spread their wings out behind them. All these rules have exceptions however.</p>
